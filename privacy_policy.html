<body>
<h1>Privacy Policy for History Autowipe</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 7, 2025</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>History Autowipe (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the History Autowipe Chrome extension collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.</p>
<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local Extension Settings:</strong> We store only your preferences in Chrome’s local storage—specifically which browsing‐data categories you’ve chosen to clear (history, cookies, cache, passwords, etc.), the interval you’ve set (in minutes, hours, days, or weeks), and timestamps for when the last and next automatic clears occur.</li>
  <li><strong>Browsing Data Deletion:</strong> When you click “Clear Now” or when an automatic alarm fires, the extension invokes Chrome’s built-in browsingData API to delete your selected data. We do not read or store any of that browsing data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>All information stays on your device:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We use your saved settings solely to drive the extension’s behavior (to know what to clear and when).</li>
  <li>We record timestamps of clear events so you can see in the popup when the last and next clears occur.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or transfer any information—settings or otherwise—to any third parties. No analytics, telemetry, or crash-reporting services are employed.</p>
<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All data is kept in Chrome’s secure extension storage on your local machine.</li>
  <li>We do not transmit any data over the network.</li>
  <li>Because data never leaves your browser, there is no risk of interception or external breach via our extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can disable automatic clearing at any time by toggling off “Auto-wipe” in the popup.</li>
  <li>You may clear all of your saved settings by uninstalling the extension or by manually clearing extension storage via Chrome’s extension management page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>History Autowipe is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy to reflect future changes. If so, we will update the “Effective Date” above. Continued use of the extension after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>
<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
